A facebook clone having obeject oriented programming practices made using c++ language.

It was made as a final project for my course Object Oriented Programming during my 2nd Semester at [National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences](http://nu.edu.pk/).

## How to Run

There's a file named "Miniature Facebook.exe". Just run it and the program will execute.

If "Miniature Facebook.exe" isn't working then the program can be compiled using the following method as well:

The project is compiled using the latest version of Microsoft Visual Studio. So, just install visual studio and open project file. Once the project file just click <b>Local Windows Debugger</b> icon and the program will start.
